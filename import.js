		"title": "The Eleventh Hour",
		"description": "The failing TARDIS crash-lands in England outside the home of seven-year-old Amelia Pond (Caitlin Blackwood), who invites the newly-regenerated Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) inside to investigate a crack in her bedroom wall. Since he must use the TARDIS to regulate its engines, he promises to return in five minutes. The TARDIS takes him twelve years into the future, where he joins the adult Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and her boyfriend Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) in capturing the shape-shifting alien known as Prisoner Zero (who has escaped from the crack in Amy's wall). Failure to capture the alien will lead to the destruction of Earth by the galactic police force known as the Atraxi. After the Earth is saved, the Doctor tests the newly-remodelled TARDIS and accidentally returns for Amy two years later—the night before her marriage to Rory—when she joins him for his promised travels through space and time.",

		"description": "The Doctor takes Amy to the distant future, where they explore the Starship UK: a spaceship holding the population of the United Kingdom (with the exception of Scotland) after they fled Earth due to dangerous solar flares. They discover that the ship is guided by a Star Whale, who is being tortured out of the fear that when left to make its own decisions it will abandon them. Believing that the future cannot go on this way, the Doctor prepares to render the Star Whale brain-dead so it will continue to operate the ship but not feel pain. Amy discovers that it is willing to serve the ship, since it could not stand the children crying because of the solar flares.",

		"title": "Victory of the Daleks",
		"description": "The Doctor and Amy respond to a call from Winston Churchill (Ian McNeice) and visit him during the London Blitz, where he has employed Ironsides: an invention apparently created by Professor Bracewell (Bill Paterson). The Doctor sees through the ruse and recognises the Ironsides as his arch-enemies, the Daleks. They use the Doctor's testimony that he is the Doctor to activate the Progenitor Chamber (which contains pure Dalek DNA) to restore their race with five new Daleks in larger, redesigned casings. The Daleks reveal their plan to detonate a device built around Bracewell (revealed as an android created by the Daleks) and destroy the Earth. As the device begins to activate, the Doctor and Amy convince Bracewell that he is human and the device deactivates.",
